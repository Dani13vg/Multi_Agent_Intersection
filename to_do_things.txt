Objectives

1) Create new intersections with the sumo editor netedit (watching video tutorials). ✅
2) Get used to the scripts generating data and the data from the xml and csv files. ✅
3) Generate a video of the csv data using matplotlib to see how the data looks like. ✅
4) Try to generate new data and augment it with the new intersections. ✅
5) Train the model with the new data and intersections. ✅
6) Test the model with the new data and intersections in the CARLA_SUMO simulation. (Segmentation fault problems).
7) Try testing on Only Sumo simulation with teletransportation. (Segmentation fault problems). 
8) Implement the car transportation system.
9) Create binary images that represent the structure of the intersection maps. ✅
10) Train an autoencoder to generate an embedding of the intersection maps. ✅
11) Train the MTP model with multiple intersections at the same time.
12) Modify the MTP model to use the intersection map embedding as input.
13) Modify the MTP dataloader to load the intersection map embedding.
